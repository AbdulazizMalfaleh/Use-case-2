# World Happiness Report
1. **Use display() not print()**:
   - because the use dataframe
   

2. **Viewing the dataframe**:
   - use the head because it is easy to read 

3. **Data Profiling**:
   - use the info show information 
   - use shape for chick of information for how many null and size of row 

4. **Training the Model**:
   - Split your dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of your model.
   - Train your model on the training set.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate your model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Additionally, consider cross-validation techniques to ensure the robustness of your model.

6. **Fine-tuning**:
   - If necessary, fine-tune hyperparameters of your model to optimize its performance.
   - You can use techniques like grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning.

7. **Prediction**:
   - Once you are satisfied with your model's performance, you can use it to predict happiness scores for new data points.

8. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy your model in a suitable environment, depending on your application requirements. This could be a web application, a mobile app, or integration into an existing system.

Remember to interpret the results of your model carefully and consider the limitations of using only these factors to predict happiness scores. Additional factors not included in the dataset may also influence happiness levels.
